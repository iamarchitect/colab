Final invoices must be submitted within 60 days of the end date of the Contract. Contractor recognizes that in many cases Portland ltd’ donor will not reimburse Portland ltd for invoices submitted beyond 60 days after the termination of a contract and therefore Portland ltd will have no obligation to pay any portion of invoices received more than 60 days after the end date of the Contract. Each invoice will include (i) the Contract Number; (ii) Contractor’s name and address; (iii) a description of the Services performed, (iv) the dates such Services were performed, (v) a pricing calculation based on the payment terms, (vi) properly reimbursable expenses (if any) incurred along with receipts for such expenses (if applicable) for all individual expenses exceeding $25 USD, and (vii) such other information as Portland ltd may reasonably request.  Invoices will only be deemed received on the date they are delivered to the Authorized Representative pursuant to the Payment Terms (see Schedule I).  If Portland ltd determines that Services that are the subject of an invoice have not been performed in accordance with the Statement of Services, Portland ltd may dispute the invoice by sending Contractor notice of such dispute after Portland ltd’ receipt of the invoice. Such notice shall clearly state the specific Services disputed, and Portland ltd’ reason for disputing the performance of the Services. If both parties accept the dispute of the invoice, they shall agree in writing as to the steps required of Contractor to ensure that the performance of the disputed Services is subsequently completed in accordance with the Additional Terms, and the time required of Contractor to complete the Services.\"\n",
